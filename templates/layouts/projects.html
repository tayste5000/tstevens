				<li class="projects__item"><a href="/projects/p2drive/intro" class="project__link">param2drive</a> - This is a webservice that computes simple biochemical parameters of a protein from a user-submitted sequence and saves the resulting information in a text document that is inserted into the users google drive account.</li>
				<li class="projects__item"><a target="_blank" href="http://vidhop.tv/" class="project__link">vidhop.tv</a> - This is a website I made with my friend and associate <a target="_blank" href="http://valentino.io/">Valentino Constintanou</a> that automaticaly streams high quality videos from youtube with a focus on interesting and entertaining content. You can choose one or multiple channels to customize your experience. The goal of this project is to create a convenient and more educational alternative to TV.</li>
				<li class="projects__item"><a href="/projects/structures">Interactive structure presentation</a> - This is an interactive presentation on protein structure. This presentation covers the basic concepts of structural biology, a field of science that is centered around the study of the 3D shapes that proteins and other biological molecules form and how their shapes are connected with biological processes. Each part of this presentation is coupled with a 3D demonstration of the subject that you can rotate, zoom, and shift. It will work on mobile devices and computers with modern browsers.</li>
